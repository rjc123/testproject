Prototypist projects are about quickly prototyping a project.

Getting a landing page, social handles, and initial descriptions up and running take time. This is about having a default quick-start point for personal projects that force the answer to a specific and defined set of questions.

1. The Market Survey, Business Concept and First Research

2. Landing pages and social presence

3. The first ten tasks to get set up

4. The next fifty tasks to making it work

... and so on.
